Vala bindings for the DevHelp library

This is my first attempt at generating Vala bindings.

To regenerate the bindings, run 'make clean' and then 'make'.

To install the bindings, run 'make install' and the .vapi file will be copied
to Vala's vapi directory.

To remove the .vapi file from Vala's vapi directory, run 'make uninstall'.
